The Bun runtime contract is composed of 0 surface modules drafted from the test corpus. Per [Doc 704 §3](https://jaredfoy.com/resolve/doc/704-the-port-as-translation-is-a-category-error), target-language derivation operates over this composition; the constraint set is the durable artifact and target-language implementations are ephemeral cache.
