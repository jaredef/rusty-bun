# AbortController — surface constraints derived from the Bun test corpus

*Auto-drafted from `derive-constraints invert` over the bun test corpus extraction at rusty-bun/runs/2026-05-10-bun-derive-constraints. This file is a draft constraint document in the [rederive grammar](https://github.com/jaredef/rederive). The substrate at rederive's derive step interprets the prose into target-language code; this draft is keeper-authorable scaffold, not final spec. See [Doc 704 (The 'Port' as Translation Is a Category Error)](https://jaredfoy.com/resolve/doc/704-the-port-as-translation-is-a-category-error) for the apparatus this output serves.*
